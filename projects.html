            <p class="opening-paragraph">Over the past year, I have worked on several exciting projects that showcase my skills in software development and problem-solving. These projects range from creating a custom programming language interpreter to developing a healthcare database system and even building a blockchain network for vehicle title management. Below, I provide a detailed overview of each project and its unique challenges and solutions.</p>

            <h2 class>Language Interpreter</h2>
            <p class="black-p">This project involved designing and implementing a programming language interpreter as part of my Programming Languages class. The interpreter supports a core grammar for arithmetic and boolean operations. I extended its functionality to include image manipulation features, enabling users to perform tasks like resizing and filtering images programmatically. This project deepened my understanding of language parsing and compiler design.</p>

            <h2 class>Healthcare Database</h2>
            <p class="black-p">In my Software Engineering class, my team and I developed a comprehensive healthcare database system. The system includes interfaces tailored for healthcare providers and managers, streamlining patient record management and administrative tasks. My primary contribution was designing and implementing the provider terminal's front-end, ensuring a user-friendly and efficient experience for medical professionals.</p>

            <h2 class>Blockchain Network</h2>
            <p class="black-p">While working in an R&D department at a Toyota dealership, I collaborated with a partner to create a blockchain-based network for managing vehicle liens and titles. This system provides a secure and efficient way to store and interact with vehicle ownership records, reducing costs and processing times for both consumers and dealerships. My role focused on designing the blockchain's architecture and developing its core functionality.</p>
