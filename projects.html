            <p class="black-p">Here are just a few of the projects that I have been working on over the past year or so
                within my classes at Portland State University. The first one is a language interpreter that I built in
                my Programming Languages class. It is built up from a core grammar that supports basic arithmetic all
                the way to complex boolean evaluations, from there I expanded the language to support image manipulation
                as it quickly became a basis for an image editing tool. The second one is a fully functional healthcare
                database with an interface for both healthcare providers and managers. My group built that one together
                in CS314, and I was directly responsible for a lot of the provider terminal front-end code. The third
                one is a blockchain network that I built with a partner while working for a r&d department within a
                Toyota dealership. It's purpose is to have an interface to store and interact with vehicle leins and
                titles, effectively saving a whole bunch of time and money for both consumers and dealers. </p>
